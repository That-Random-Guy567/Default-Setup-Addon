# Plan for addon
Have addon be customizable with Functions
- save the custom features to a local file on disk
- have output save to local dir in folder named "frames"

Default Setup
    - Render
        - Render engine to cycles
            - edits settings like denoiser
        - Help with scene optimization
            - changes the render settings for (hopefully) faster renders
            
    - Output
        - output as 1440p
        - output as 1920x1080p (for tiktok/yt shorts)
        - output as OpenEXR (single channel)s
        - output as mp4 video

    - File Sharing
        - pack resources
        - set files to relative path
        - purge unused data

    - Physics
        - Cloth Simulations 
            - Add cloth simulations, collisions and clearing them
        - Rigid Bodies
            - Adding/removing them, altering collision objects

    - Object Constraints
        - "Track to" contraint added
            - funcionality will be improved later
    
    - Miscellaneoous Functions
        - Toggling some specific overlays such as scene stats
        - Add a rainbow colour material
        - Add rainbow colour ramp (single colour ramp)
        - Fine tuned sky texture
